[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Give me a program that remap the CAPSLOCK key to A and A key to CAPSLOCK, the program must have two buttons in it, first one MapKeys and second ReverseKeys, when i press the MapKeys, the CAPSLOCK remapped to A and A key remapped to CAPSLOCK,and when i press ReverseKeys, the keys restored to it's original keys, like A must act as A and CAPSLOCK must act as CAPSLOCK.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

        self.geometry("300x200")

        self.map_button.pack(pady=10)
        
        self.reverse_button = tk.Button(self, text="ReverseKeys", command=self.reverse_keys)
        self.reverse_button.pack(pady=10)
        
    def map_keys(self):
        keyboard.remap_key("capslock", "a")
        keyboard.remap_key("a", "capslock")

        keyboard.remap_key("capslock", "capslock")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = KeyRemapperApp()
    app.mainloop()

```

In this code, we create a `KeyRemapperApp` class that inherits from `tkinter.Tk` to create the GUI application. The `map_keys` method remaps the CAPSLOCK key to A and the A key to CAPSLOCK using the `keyboard.remap_key` function. The `reverse_keys` method restores the original key mappings. The `map_button` and `reverse_button` are created as `tkinter.Button` widgets and their commands are set to the respective methods. Finally, we create an instance of `KeyRemapperApp` and start the main event loop.

Next, we need to install the `keyboard` module, which is not a built-in module in Python. We can install it using the `pip` package manager. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install keyboard
```

Once the installation is complete, you can run the `main.py` file to launch the Key Remapper application.

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code seems to be missing the import statement for the tkinter module. Without importing tkinter, the GUI implementation will not work. Please add the following line at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

Also, make sure that the keyboard module is installed. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install keyboard
```

Once you have made these changes, the code should work as expected.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statement for the `keyboard` module. This module is required for remapping the keys. Please add the import statement for `keyboard` at the beginning of the `main.py` file.

<REVISION> Add the following import statement at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
import keyboard
```

After making this change, the code should work as expected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Chief Technology Officer: Thank you for providing the requirements.txt file. It correctly specifies the dependency on the keyboard package with version 0.13.5. This will ensure that the program can use the keyboard module for remapping the keys.

Now, let's move on to implementing the functionality requested by the customer. We can use the keyboard module in Python to achieve the key remapping. Here's an example code that demonstrates how to remap the CAPSLOCK key to A and the A key to CAPSLOCK:

```python
import keyboard

def map_keys():
    keyboard.remap_key("capslock", "a")
    keyboard.remap_key("a", "capslock")

def reverse_keys():
    keyboard.remap_key("a", "a")
    keyboard.remap_key("capslock", "capslock")

# Main program loop
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter 'map' to remap keys or 'reverse' to restore original keys: ")
    
    if user_input == "map":
        map_keys()
        print("Keys remapped successfully!")
    elif user_input == "reverse":
        reverse_keys()
        print("Keys restored to original!")
    else:
        print("Invalid input. Please try again.")
```

In this code, we define two functions: `map_keys()` and `reverse_keys()`. The `map_keys()` function remaps the CAPSLOCK key to A and the A key to CAPSLOCK using the `keyboard.remap_key()` function. The `reverse_keys()` function restores the original key mappings.

The main program loop continuously prompts the user for input. If the user enters "map", the `map_keys()` function is called to remap the keys. If the user enters "reverse", the `reverse_keys()` function is called to restore the original key mappings. Any other input is considered invalid.

Please note that this code assumes that the keyboard module is already installed and imported. You can use the requirements.txt file we created earlier to install the keyboard package using pip.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
